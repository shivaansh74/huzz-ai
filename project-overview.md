HuzzAI – The Ultimate AI-Powered Rizz Coach
Tagline: No more dry texts. No more Ls. Just straight W-rizz.

📌 Project Overview
HuzzAI is a Gen Z-focused AI wingman that helps users improve their texting game, get pickup line suggestions, and receive feedback on photos. Users can upload screenshots of conversations or profile pictures, and the app will generate optimal responses, captions, and pickup lines.

Key Features
💬 AI-Generated Rizz Coach (Text Response Generator)

Users input a screenshot of their convo or a text snippet, and AI provides a smooth, well-crafted response.
Recovery Mode for when users get ghosted, hit with a dry response, or fumble.
Slider to adjust tone:
Chill (casual, respectful, playful)
Flirty (mildly suggestive, teasing)
Spicy (bold, confident, straight W-rizz)
📸 AI-Powered Image Rizz Analyzer (Powered by Google Gemini API)

Users upload a selfie, fit pic, or group photo, and AI gives:
Drip check: Analyzes outfit, pose, and overall aesthetic.
Caption suggestions: Generates flirty, funny, or edgy captions.
Vibe rating: Tells you if the pic is a “W” or needs work.
"Would They Swipe?": Predicts if your pic would get a right swipe.
🔥 Pick-Up Line Generator (With Tone Control)

Users input a topic or scenario, and AI generates a pickup line.
Tone slider (from "cute & playful" to "downright smooth operator").
Example input prompts:
"At a coffee shop" → "Are you a latte? Because you’ve got me feeling extra bold today."
"Gym rizz" → "Are you a deadlift? Because I can’t pick up anything heavier than my feelings for you."
🧠 AI Chat to Simulate Flirting & Small Talk

Users practice their game with the AI before texting IRL.
AI tests different responses to see what works.
Can be set to respond like a “hard-to-get” match or an “instantly interested” match.

💡 How Each Feature Works
1️⃣ AI Text Response Generator
✅ User Flow:

User uploads a screenshot of a conversation OR manually types a message.
App extracts text from the screenshot (using OCR) or takes user input directly.
AI analyzes context and suggests a smooth response.
User selects a tone (chill, flirty, spicy) via slider.
AI generates a response based on the selected tone.
User copies the response or tweaks it before using.
✅ Implementation Steps:

Use Google Gemini API for text-based response generation.
If using screenshots, implement OCR (Tesseract.js or Gemini's vision model) to extract text.
Apply prompt engineering to fine-tune Gemini’s responses based on selected tone.
2️⃣ AI Image-Based Rizz Analyzer (Google Gemini Vision API)
✅ User Flow:

User uploads a profile pic or fit pic.
AI analyzes the background, outfit, facial expressions, and lighting.
AI generates:
Caption suggestions
Vibe check (W or L?)
Style feedback (e.g., “Drip level: Certified Snack” or “Needs more sauce”)
Swipe Prediction (e.g., “7/10 right swipe probability”)
User copies the caption or uses feedback to improve pics.
✅ Implementation Steps:

Use Google Gemini Vision API to analyze uploaded images.
Use AI-generated text prompts for captions and feedback.
Build a rating system that categorizes images as “W”, “Mid”, or “L” based on AI analysis.
